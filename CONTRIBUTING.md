# Contributing to Maraya

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to **Maraya** — a modern, modular platform for Dynamic Risk Profiling (DRP).  
This repository serves as the central hub for the entire Maraya ecosystem, and we deeply value high-quality, thoughtful contributions.

## 🧭 Contribution Guidelines

Maraya is structured as a **multi-repo project**, with each component (services, APIs, frontend, documentation, etc.) living in its own repository.

### 🔗 Component Repositories

- **maraya-services**: Microservices for infrastructure scanning and web crawling.
- **maraya-backend**: APIs built with Spring Boot for backend logic and orchestration.
- **maraya-frontend-web**: Web UI built with React.
- **maraya-frontend-mobile**: Mobile app using React Native.
- **maraya-docs**: Documentation powered by Docusaurus.

Each of these has its own:
- Contribution process
- Issue tracker
- Branching model
- Roadmap

> ⚠️ **Note:** Technical issues, feature requests, and micro-tasks should be opened in the relevant sub-repository. This main repo is reserved for project-level coordination, planning, and documentation.
